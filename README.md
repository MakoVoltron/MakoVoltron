Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Mate, video maker with a passion for code, and this is where I'm gonna park all my nerdy passions projects.

ðŸš€ My first larger app PreschoolFinder is LIVe

Go see it here https://preschoolfinder.net

ðŸ¤– The app is built in Node.js/Express and hosted on Heroku.

It uses several third-party APIs such as:

-Cloudinary | for image hosting
-MapBox | for Geocoding and address autocomplete
-Mongo DB | for database
-Postmark | for transactional emails (new account, password recovery, etc...)

Since the app functionality is tightly dependent on these APIs, it's not possible to just Clone and run a fully functional app without providing credentials for each in the config/config.env file.
